# Record a DELIBERATE skip of a pre-push reviewer for the current HEAD.
#
# This is the SANCTIONED way for /prepush to skip a reviewer it judges
# out-of-lane for the diff (e.g. the code reviewer on a docs-only typo), so a
# trivial change doesn't pay for a full review. It:
#   1. writes the reviewer's marker tmp/<name>-passed-<HEAD>  (satisfies the
#      push gate in .claude/hooks/agent-bash-gate.sh), and
#   2. logs "<name>\t<reason>" to tmp/review-skips-<HEAD>.log for audit
#      (surfaced by the gate on push and by /prepush to the user).
#
# Use this instead of hand-touching a marker: the skip is then deliberate and
# recorded, not silent. The orchestrator's judgment is the gate here (a choice
# made deliberately — see AGENTS.md §"Don't bypass the gates"); when in doubt,
# RUN the reviewer instead of skipping it.
#
# Usage: scripts/skip-pre-push-review.sh <reviewer> "<reason>"
