# Canonical PR-title (Conventional Commits) validator. The SINGLE rule the local
# pre-create gate (.claude/hooks/agent-bash-gate.sh) checks against, kept identical
# to the required `pr-title` check (.github/workflows/pr-title.yml) so a bad title
# is caught BEFORE `gh pr create` instead of after the required check fails — the
# recurring "title too long / wrong format" round-trip. Squash-merge uses the PR
# title as the commit subject, which release-please parses for the version bump,
# so the format isn't cosmetic: it drives releases.
#
# Usage:  scripts/lint-pr-title.sh "<title>"     (or pipe the title on stdin)
# Exit:   0 = valid; 1 = invalid (human-readable reason on stderr).
# Env:    PR_TITLE_SKIP_LENGTH=1  exempt the length cap (Dependabot grouped updates).
#         PR_TITLE_MAX_LEN=N      override the 72-char cap.
#
# Rule (KEEP IN SYNC with CONTRIBUTING.md's type list):
#   <type>(optional-scope)(optional-!): <subject>
#   - type in {feat,fix,docs,refactor,test,chore,ci,deps,build,perf,revert,style}
#   - subject starts lowercase (house style) and has no trailing period
#   - title <= 72 chars (it becomes the squash-merge commit subject on main)
