# PostToolUse hook: auto-format edited JS/TS/JSON files with Biome after edits.
#
# Why a hook: catches format drift at write time so commits never carry
# fmt-failing files (the `biome check` step in `pnpm run verify` — and thus the
# pre-commit hook and CI — would otherwise block), and works in
# bypassPermissions mode where prompts for `pnpm run format` wouldn't appear.
#
# Safety: best-effort. If Biome can't parse the file (a mid-edit syntax error),
# it leaves the file alone — we silently skip rather than blocking the edit.
# (`.astro` files are NOT in the case list: Biome 2.x doesn't parse Astro
# single-file components, so it would no-op on them anyway — their embedded
# <style>/<script> are hand-tuned and out of Biome's scope.)
