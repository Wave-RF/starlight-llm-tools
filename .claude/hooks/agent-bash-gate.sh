# Agent PR workflow gate (PreToolUse Bash). Catches accidental violations of

#   - gh pr create without --draft
#   - gh pr ready
#   - gh pr edit --add-reviewer / --add-assignee
#   - gh api .../requested_reviewers (write verbs)
#   - gh pr review --approve / --request-changes

# Universal git checks (verify marker, no-verify, etc.) live in .githooks/ and
# apply to humans and agents equally. Bypass surface acknowledged: an agent that
# wants to bypass can edit this file or settings.json — these rules prevent
# accidental violations, not adversarial ones. See AGENTS.md §"Agent PR
# Discipline" for policy.

# review entirely. Trade-off: this also gates WIP/throwaway feature-branch pushes;

Run /prepush — it reads ${reviewers_script}, runs the reviewers this change needs
in parallel (fresh context), and skips the rest on the record. Each reviewer it
runs must reach VERDICT: ship_it (zero findings) to write its marker; a skipped
reviewer gets a logged marker via scripts/skip-pre-push-review.sh. The push
succeeds once every listed reviewer has a marker — see AGENTS.md §"Agent PR
