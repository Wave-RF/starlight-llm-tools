# SubagentStop hook — writes a pre-push review marker.
#
# The subagents that gate a push are listed in scripts/pre-push-reviewers.sh
# (the single source of truth — today code + docs review, tomorrow security or
# more). Each listed reviewer <name> gates the push with its own HEAD-keyed
# marker tmp/<name>-passed-<HEAD-sha>. When that subagent's last assistant
# message ends with `VERDICT: ship_it`, this hook writes the marker. The
# pre-push gate (.claude/hooks/agent-bash-gate.sh) requires a marker for EVERY
# listed reviewer before the subsequent `git push`. Nothing here hardcodes the
# set — add a reviewer by editing scripts/pre-push-reviewers.sh.
#
# Why SubagentStop (not PostToolUse:Agent): the PostToolUse:Agent payload puts
# the subagent's final text in `.tool_response.content[].text` (array of
# content blocks), which is brittle to parse and to schema changes.
# SubagentStop exposes `.last_assistant_message` as a flat string, which is
# both stable and what we actually need. Both events do fire on subagent
# completion; we just use the one with the friendlier schema.
#
# Why this hook exists at all: the orchestrator agent must not hand-write
# tmp/<reviewer>-passed-* (policy in AGENTS.md §"Don't bypass the gates").
# Hooks run at Claude Code privilege level, NOT subject to the permission
# system, so this is the only honest path to creating a marker. The subagent's
# verdict is the gate; the orchestrator can't fake it because each reviewer
# runs in fresh context with the canonical system prompt from
# .claude/agents/<name>.md.
